**Note: This was an attempt to create a login system. I decided that I didn't want one anymore so I shelved it for now.**

This is the code for my [website](http://eldosdumpingground.de)

run site with (needs sudo to use 0.0.0.0 host)
```bash
sudo flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80
```
be carefull, because this command will open up port 80 for a webserver even on your public ip
